### Instructions for Running the Scripts
1. **Create the Script**: Save each of the above code blocks into separate files, e.g., `script1.sh`, `script2.sh`, etc.
2. **Make the Script Executable**: Use the following command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script1.sh
   ```
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   ./script1.sh
   ```

These scripts cover all the tasks, and you can modify them as needed. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
